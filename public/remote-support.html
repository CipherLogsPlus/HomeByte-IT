        <h1>Secure Remote Sessions &mdash; By Appointment Only</h1>
        <p>HomeByte IT offers scheduled remote service for software troubleshooting, cleanups, and tune-ups. Every session is booked in advance, identity is verified, and you remain in control of your device the entire time.</p>

        <h2>Before Your Appointment</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At your scheduled time, download AnyDesk directly from the official website:<br>
                <a href="https://anydesk.com/en/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://anydesk.com/en/downloads</a>
            </li>
            <li>Launch AnyDesk and have your AnyDesk Address/ID ready to share when we call.</li>
            <li>Close private applications, save open work, and create a fresh backup of important files whenever possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>During the Session</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We request access through AnyDesk; approve the request only if it lists HomeByte IT.</li>
            <li>You can watch every step we take and end the session at any moment.</li>
            <li>With your permission we may install, update, or remove software required to resolve the issue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security &amp; Consent</h2>
        <p>Participating in a remote session authorizes HomeByte IT to access and control your device solely for diagnosis and repair. We never rehost or modify AnyDesk and are not affiliated with AnyDesk Software GmbH. Do not share passwords over chat, and change any credentials supplied during the session once service is complete.</p>

        <h2>Billing</h2>
        <p>Remote support uses the same pricing as on-site visits: <strong>$50 per hour (1-hour minimum)</strong>, billed in one-hour increments. The <strong>$20 diagnostic fee</strong> is waived if you approve repair work. Prices exclude applicable Pennsylvania sales tax.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 18px; color: #4b5563;">Ready to schedule? Use the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> and mention "Remote Support" in your message. We'll respond with available appointment windows and a confirmation email outlining the steps above.</p>
