        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 24, 2025</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern every service appointment, remote session, estimate, or consultation conducted by HomeByte IT (“HomeByte IT,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By scheduling or receiving service you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Company Information</h2>

            <li>All work is performed on a <strong>best-effort basis</strong>. We do not warrant that any service will resolve every issue, permanently prevent malware, or restore lost data.</li>
            <li>We may decline or discontinue service if, in our professional judgment, continuing would be unsafe, unlawful, disrespectful, or outside our expertise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
